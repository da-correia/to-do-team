## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
``` c
Many South African households are living under a tremendous debt burden. In fact, according to the National Research Foundation, SA has one of the highest household debt-to-income ratios in the world, reaching highs of as much as 77.1% which simply means for every Rand earned, it owes 77 cents. This leaves them with a mere 33 cents per Rand to live on, which impacts their welfare and slows down our country's economic growth. 

This is our attempt to help.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

* The ability to add interest-bearing investments as well, turning it into a wealth tracker that can underpin future rags-to-riches stories in the country. 
* Adding more badges and achievements to further motivate people to reach their financial freedom goals.
