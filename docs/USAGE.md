# Usage Guide

## ▶️ Running the Application
Be sure to be in correct directory with
``` bash
cd to-do-team/src/app/to-do
```

and then

``` bash
npm run dev
```

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. From the landing page, make sure to sign up using an actual email address.
   This is of utmost importance since we are using SupaBase Auth to authenticate users,
   and they will receive an email to verify their user account. 
2. Once that is created and you have successfully signed in, you can then begin testing
   the functionality of our app by adding some debts in the Debts page, get an overview of your financial situation on the Repayment plans page and more.
